# AI Coding Assistance Disclosure

This assignment requires transparency about AI tool usage during development.

## Instructions
Please complete the sections below honestly. Using AI tools is **acceptable and expected**. We want to understand **how** you used them.


## 1. AI Tools Used
List all AI coding assistants used.


## 2. Components Assisted
Check which parts received AI assistance:

- [ ] Data extraction logic (Excel parsing, MASTER sheet)
- [ ] Data modeling design (ERD, table schemas, SCD Type 2)
- [ ] ETL pipeline implementation
- [ ] Data validation framework
- [ ] API endpoint development (FastAPI)
- [ ] Docker/Docker Compose configuration
- [ ] SQL queries and migrations
- [ ] Testing (unit/integration tests)
- [ ] Documentation (README, comments)
- [ ] Debugging specific issues
- [ ] Other: ___________


## 3. Detailed Description
For each major component, describe how AI assisted.


## 4. Chat History / Logs
Attach or link to chat history logs showing AI interactions.

**Format:** PDF, Markdown, screenshots, or text files
**Location:** [Provide links or attach files here]

**Note:** You may redact personal information but maintain enough context to show the AI interaction.


## 5. Self-Assessment
Reflect on your AI usage:

**What did AI do well?**

**What did you need to correct or override?**

**What did you implement entirely on your own?**

**How did AI tools improve your development process?**

**Were there any limitations or challenges with AI assistance?**


## 6. Recommendations
Based on your experience, what advice would you give to others using AI tools for data engineering tasks?




Thank you for your transparency!
